              To my surprise, Nintendo's DS is the platform that appears most frequently in the dataset. Comparatively, its mean and median sales place quite low compared to other platforms. This indicates that although the DS is a popular platform, this does not guarantee/ translate to success in the selling of the games created for the platform.

              Not as surprising, Action and Sports are the most frequent game genre. This aligns with what I know about the gaming industry from an outsider persepctive, with these genres being more common. Interestingly, when looking at the mean and median genre global sales, Action and Sports are less consistent in sales. Platform being the highest selling genre for both mean and median global sales was quite a surprise!

                Something taken away from analyzing the Publisher variable, is the difference in quality versus quantity. While some larger companies (like EA) appear due to the large amount of games they have released, their mean and median global sales are usually lower than expected. In contrast, smaller publishers may rank higher in median sales, due to lower volume of releases (if some of these were successful).

              <h5>Visualization 1.1 : Which genres of Nintendo DS games are most globally successful? </h5>
               <p>I chose to examine the Nintendo DS, because it has the largest number of games in the dataset (making it useful for finding sales patterns) and also out of personal curiousity as someone born in the early 2000's when everyone was using these consoles.</p>
              <p>This indicates that global sales on the Nintendo DS are not evenly distributed across genres, with a small number of genres accounting for a disproportionately large amount of total sales (Misc, Simulation and Role-Playing). The dominance in sales, of Simulation and Role-Playing genres, suggests that users resonated with replayable game experiences. This paired with the physical DS console, with its small screen and toucpad pen, makes sense as to why genres like Fighting and Shooter were the least grossing in global sales. </p>

              <h5>Visualization 1.2 : Which platforms sold the most Platform genre games globally?</h5>
              <p>I looked at Platform games across different consoles, because this genre was the highest performing in mean global sales, and I wondered how the platform contributed to success in sales.</p>
              <p>A noticeable trend, based on the top five performing platforms Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Wii, Game Boy Advance (GBA), Nintendo DS, and PlayStation 2 (PS2), is that excluding  PS2 these are all platforms published by Nintendo.</p>
              <p>The dominance of Nintendo platforms among the top sellers of Platform games suggests a strong relationship between platform design, publisher identity, and the commercial success of this genre.</p>

              <h5>Visualization 2.1 : How has global game sales changed over time across major platforms?</h5>
              <p>The visualization shows an overall decline in global video game sales over time, with most major platforms peaking between 2005 and 2010.</p>
              <p>This shared peak suggests an industry high point driven by small number of dominant platforms, rather than isolated a publisher or genre trends. Major publishers such as Nintendo, EA, and Activision consistently dominated sales across these platforms, showing that both platform and publisher presence shaped market peaks. After this period, sales decrease across platforms, indicating an industry shift in how games were either produced, distributed, or consumed.</p>

               <h5>Visualization 2.2 : How have global sales trends changed across genres over time?</h5>
               <p> Reinforcing what can be seen in my 2.1 Visualization, is that all major genres peaked around 2008 and began to decline afterwards. Action games led in total sales, followed by Misc, Role-Playing, Shooter, and Sports.</p>
               <p>After 2008, sales gradually declined across genres, reflecting industry shifts in production, and platform saturation. This shows that while platforms influenced overall market peaks, genre popularity added another layer and some genres consistently outperformed others (regardless of platform).</p>

              <p>Based on my visualization, North America (NA) and Europe (EU) lead in sales with platforms like PS, PS2, PS3, X360, Wii and DS. On the other hand, Japan (JP) while lower in numbers, perfers hand held consoles, like the DS and NES. </p>

              <p>Expanding off of 3.1, a clear pattern emerges where North America, Europe, and the Other region have similar trends across both platform and genre sales. In these regions, Action, Sports and Shooter games dominate, aligning with the popularity of home consoles like PlayStation, XBox and Wii.</p>

              <h5>Visualization 4.1 : How do Nintendo-published games perform by genre in Japan?</h5>
              <p>Nintendo's game sales in Japan are mainly concentrated within Platform and Role-Playing (with Misc bringing up the rear). There is a noticeable drop off in the the bar chart after these genres. This suggests that Japanese sales are deiven by specific playing styles. These genres also align with popular Nintendo franchises (Legend of Zelda, Pokemon, MarioKart, Animal Crossing, etc) that are more character and narrative based.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5>Visualization 4.2 : Does Nintendo’s success in Japan come from handheld platforms rather than home consoles?</h5>
              <p>The dominant genres, paired with Nintendo's most successful platforms in Japan (DS, Game Boy, and NES) which are all handheld or hybrid platforms, allow for "on the go" gaming experience. These platforms aligns with the top game genres in Japan, allowing for convinient and casual gaming that also matches well with the commuting lifestyle that most Japanese people in major cities experience. </p>

              <p>Nintendo’s success in Japan is driven by a close alignment between platform design, publishing strategy, and the lifestyles and preferences of Japanese players.</p>
