            <p>
              To my surprise, Nintendo's DS is the platform that appears most frequently in the dataset. Comparatively, its mean and median sales place quite low compared to other platforms. This indicates that although the DS is a popular platform, this does not guarantee/ translate to success in the selling of the games created for the platform.

            <h4>type of video game</h4>
            <p>
              Not as surprising, Action and Sports are the most frequent game genre. This aligns with what I know about the gaming industry from an outsider persepctive, with these genres being more common. Interestingly, when looking at the mean and median genre global sales, Action and Sports are less consistent in sales. Platform being the highest selling genre for both mean and median global sales was quite a surprise!

                Something taken away from analyzing the Publisher variable, is the difference in quality versus quantity. While some larger companies (like EA) appear due to the large amount of games they have released, their mean and median global sales are usually lower than expected. In contrast, smaller publishers may rank higher in median sales, due to lower volume of releases (if some of these were successful).
