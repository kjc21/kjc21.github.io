<!--Create a new page where you can display your visualization portfolio. 

You will include:
One SVG version of the visualization you have chosen. You choose what to visualize; you'll get an extra score if you are creative (you may use the sketch diagram we asked for in the first session it's up to you).

Some creative SVG art using JS.

JUST PUT YOUR VISUALIZATIONS ON THIS PAGE. USE JS FOR CREATING VISUALIZATIONS.-->
